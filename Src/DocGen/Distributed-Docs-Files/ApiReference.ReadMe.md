## Temporal SDK for .NET
# API Reference & Documentation

This archive / folder contains a static website that contains the documentation for the .NET SDK.

Most of the site's functionality can be accessed directly by open the files on the hard drive with a browser. Some links may be broken. Just try another link of navigate to a file manually.

For full functionality the site needs to be hosted. There is no dynamic server-side functionality. Everything is just client-side Javascript. The hosting mainly just ensures that all relative paths are correct. 

You can host any method you like. If you are using Windows, you can do it with a single command:

Invoke the `HostDocs.bat` script included with this archive. (You can use the console or you can just double-click it.)
It will download a copy of [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html) from Github into a local directory and host the documentation using the built-in _serve_ functionality.

In the future, we will make the API Reference Docs available in a hosted form. Watch the [.NET SDK Repo](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet) for further announcements.
