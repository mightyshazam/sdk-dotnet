    /// <summary>
    /// In this Part we consider similarities and differences between 2 key concepts in Temporal:
    /// "Workflow Chain" and "Workflow Run".
    /// 
    /// Workflow Chain:
    /// Technically, a Temporal workflow is a chain-sequence of one or more Workflow Runs from the initial
    /// invocation of a workflow to its eventual conclusion. Thus, a logical workflow (as in "just" workflow,
    /// or "the" workflow) is really a Workflow Chain.           
    ///
    /// Workflow Run:
    /// A single execution of the main workflow routine.
    /// Completely executing a workflow from the initial invocation to the eventual conclusion involves a chain
    /// of one or more Workflow Runs.
    ///
    /// The Temporal server orchestrates the execution of workflows by ensuring that Workers execute Workflow
    /// Runs as required to complete a Workflow Chain (aka a logical Workflow).
    /// Within the Client SDK:
    ///  * Workflow Chains are modeled by instances of type `IWorkflowHandle`.
    ///  * Workflow Runs are modeled by instances of type `IWorkflowRunHandle`.
    ///
    /// In most scenarios, users only need to interact with logical workflows, i.e., with Workflow Chains
    /// via the respective `IWorkflowHandle` instances. For example, when a user needs to send a signal to
    /// a workflow (or perform a query, terminate, cancel, etc...) they invoke a corresponding
    /// `IWorkflowHandle` API. Under the covers, the handle automatically interacts with the current Run
    /// within the Workflow Chain it represents. Similarly, when a users polls for the result of a workflow,
    /// the respective `IWorkflowHandle` API automatically "follows" the chain until the "final" run of a chain
    /// completes.
    /// However, in some advanced scenarios users need to explicitly interact with a specific Run within the 
    /// Workflow Chain representing a particular logical workflow. This is done using a `IWorkflowRunHandle`
    /// instances. Examples in this file demosntrate how to do that.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>This class contains usage sample intended for education and API review. It may not actually execute
    /// successfully because IDs used in these samples may not actually exist on the backing Temporal server.</remarks>
