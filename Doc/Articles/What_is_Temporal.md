# What is Temporal?

Temporal is a programming model for the Cloud that makes writing highly scalable and reliable Apps as straight forward as writing simple software that runs on a single machine.

## Why Temporal?

Temporal users consistently name it as one of the most impactful software development tools in their arsenal. What problem does Temporal solve for them?

It removes much of the "architecture-overhead" related to writing hyper-scalable, hyper-available and hyper-reliable applications. You get to focus on the business logic.

Does this sound like too-good-to-be-true "magic"? At Temporal, we are engineers, not magicians. In reality, Temporal's "magic" is a compelling programming model backed by a set of convenient SDKs and a powerful backend-system. This may sound a little like marketing-speak, but we back it up with [real user success stories](https://temporal.io/use-cases).

## Want to know more?

We will publish more details here in the future, especially related to using Temporal in .NET applications.
