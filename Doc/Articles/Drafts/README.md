# `sdk-dotnet /Doc/Articles/Resources/Drafts`

This folder contains drafts for articles. We keep articles here that we are working on, but that are not yet ready to be published.

This allows contributors to work on articles in the background, while still pushing the drafts to the repo's `master` branch. This facilitates collaboration and avoids merging and branching overhead just for working on articles.

> NOTE: <br/>
> **Article drafts located here are not published to the Docs Site, but they are still available on the public Github repo. It's fine to keep work here that is not ready for publication, but make sure it is in a state that is OK to be seen by the public still.**

See also the [ReadMe file an upper folder](./../../README.md) for additional details.
