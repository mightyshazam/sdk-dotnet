# API Reference<br /><small>Temporal SDK for .NET (_Alpha_)</small>

Temporal SDK for .NET targets 3 different Framework versions to allow using it in applications that run on all common .NET versions.

The APIs offered for each target are almost identical.
However, there are some very minor differences due to the differences in underlying .NET APIs.
For example, Net Fx and Net Core use different gRPC implementations, which requires slightly different APIs for setting gRPC options.
